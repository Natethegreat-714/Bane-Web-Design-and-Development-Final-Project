        <p>When asked about what my dream vacation spot would be, I always find myself responding with Switzerland. From cities like Geneva and Zürich to the iconic Matterhorn and the alpine town of Zermatt, Switzerland is full of exciting locations for any type of traveler. In terms of historical and architectural landmarks, Switzerland is in a league of its own with Château de Chillon in Montreux serving as just one example of the country’s rich history (see Figure 1). The diverse array of tourist hotspots and local gems make Switzerland one of the best getaway locales, as it truly has something for everyone.</p>

        <!-- Paragraph 3: What would you eat? -->
        <h2>What would you eat?</h2>
        <p>Switzerland’s culinary scene is also one of its major selling points to tourists. Due to its unique location in the heart of western Europe, Switzerland pulls a lot from its neighbor countries such as Germany, France, and Italy when it comes to cuisine, leaving visitors with plenty of options to choose from during their stay. Pastries and breads such as Zopf and Gipfeli are key staples of the country as they are fresh and locally made. Traditional local dishes such as the Berner Platte offer a variety of Swiss style sausages, potatoes, and sauerkraut that make it a must try upon visiting (see Figure 3). The country of course is also well known for its chocolates and cheeses. Offering a wide variety of artisanal crafted delicacies that range in both flavors and cost. Tasting businesses are also widely popular in Switzerland as they allow tourists to sample a diverse range of local delicacies during their visit (see Figure 4).</p>
